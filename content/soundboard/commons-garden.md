## Initial questions

### Where are you in your process?

We just finished phase 1 with initial categories (spec, wireframe), and heading to phase 2, with people and organization categories, and better integration between categories.

### What can I help you with the most?

Is this a better way to track initiatives? Any other standards we could be using? How to communicate initiative's status so others know where we stand?

### What is the objective of the design?

One of our goals is to reduce volunteer burnout by acting as a source of truth for projects with statuses, deliverables, blockers, actors. A one-stop-shop of "where are we" on each initiative.

When we surface people and organizations, it can also be used as portfolio and networking for volunteers.

### What elements of the design are related to the objective?

### Are those elements effective in achieving the objective? Why or why not?
